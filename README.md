# My Reads React App

## Introduction

> In this application, the main page displays a list of "shelves" (i.e. categories), each of which contains a number of books. The three shelves are:

- Currently Reading
- Want to Read
- Read

> Each book has a control that lets you select the shelf for that book. When you select a different shelf, the book moves there.

> Also there's a search feature so, you can look for others books


## Installation

- npm install
